# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe – Streamlit App

A simple, nostalgic game — reimagined with **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
This project was born out of a late-night “what if I could code this?” — and turned into my first interactive web app that actually makes you smile. 😄

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build a **two-player Tic Tac Toe game** using **Streamlit**, where users can take turns, track wins, and enjoy a clean, responsive UI — all inside the browser.

---

## 🧠 How it Works

- **Real-Time Gameplay**: Two players play on a dynamic 3x3 grid.
- **Winner Detection**: Checks for win/draw after every move.
- **Reset Functionality**: Start fresh with a single click.
- **Streamlit Widgets**: Used buttons and session states for smooth interaction.
- **Local or Cloud Use**: Can be run locally or deployed online via Streamlit Cloud.

---

## 📊 Behind the Scenes

- **Python Logic**: Game logic written from scratch.
- **Streamlit UI**: Clean, interactive layout using columns and widgets.
- **Lightweight**: No heavy libraries, quick to run and deploy.
- **Technologies Used**:
  - `streamlit`: UI and deployment
  - `Python`: Game logic

Built to learn. Built to feel like childhood in code form.
